The design and structure for this website was created in Video Editor.  

[![Tips From Europe](https://github.com/MohamedMesto/MohamedMesto/blob/main/Images/heilfasten_profile.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b122ta41eqY&t=67s)

## Site Structure

Love Cross Words (Fasting Treatment) consists of 6 page website with 5 pages that the user can navigate between via the navigation bar.  The Home page is the default loading page. The Logo is centered and is also linked to the Home Page. On the right hand site of the logo are five navigation links of [Home](index.html) , [Fasting Steps](fasting.html) ,[Fasting World](fasting_world.html) , [Join us](join_us.html) and [Fasting books](books.html).


## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The final color scheme chosen was shades of blue with white accents, as well as light purple and white to divide the pages. In other words, two light blue colors were used on the navigation bar, a yellow effect to highlight the active page and for a scrolling effect, and a beige color for the writing. This color scheme is in keeping with a clean, modern look but still has a touch of warmth by sticking to warmer colors like navy blue, gray, and white.

![Colour palette image of 5 colours](assets/images/readme_images/colour_palette_lyb.png)

### Typography

There were two types of fonts chosen for this website. 'Lemon' was used for the body of the text and 'Lato' for the headings, which is a slightly different version Lemon than the body text to provide emphasis. Besides, sub texts used fonts fall back to 'sans-serif'.  The Lemon fonts exude a subtle sense of luxury, enhanced by their sophisticated serifs that introduce a touch of complexity to the design. Through meticulous adjustments in letter spacing and line heights, we maintain a clean aesthetic while infusing a hint of refinement.

### HTML Validation

While no problems were indicated in the CSS file in using false css attribute represnted in hr - size, I correct it to height and the error cleared.
